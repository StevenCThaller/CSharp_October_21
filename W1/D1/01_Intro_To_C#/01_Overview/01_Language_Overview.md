# What is C#?

C# is a `strictly typed`, `compiled`, `object oriented` programming language created by
Microsoft.

Fun fact: C# got its name because the `#` symbol looks like 4 `+` symbols stuck together,
making `C#` essentially `C++++`. I'm not kidding.

## What do those funny words mean, Magic Man??

`Strictly Typed`: we must assign a data type to each and every thing that we deal with.
This includes: 
- Variables
- Functions
- Parameters

We'll learn more about what that means with regard to the functions later

`Compiled`: JavaScript is an `interpreted` language. A `compiled` language means that the code will be `compiled` in a way that the the computer will know ahead of time what/where everything is, and what to expect. 

So with a `compiled` language, it requires a little more ramp up and initialization time, but the speed of the application itself will be much quicker.

`Object Oriented`: An `object oriented` language is one in which the structure of the language itself is rooted in objects. We'll see that there's no real standalone functions, there's no just slapping a line of code in C# file and running it, and and we can't just specify a file to run.

EVERYTHING is objects.
