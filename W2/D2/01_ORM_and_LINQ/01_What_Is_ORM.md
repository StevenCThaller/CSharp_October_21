# Object Relational Mapper

`ORMs`, or `Object Relational Mappers`, allow us to create `objects` to be `mapped` to a `relational` database.

Basically, we will be using an `ORM` (in the case of this stack, `Entity Framework`) to convert code to database.

The way that `Entity` works, is it treats the data within the database as an `enumerable` dataset. 

## Enumerable what now?

An `enumerable` object is just an object that has contents ordered by a number of some sort. In short, anything you can access
a given value via an `index`.
