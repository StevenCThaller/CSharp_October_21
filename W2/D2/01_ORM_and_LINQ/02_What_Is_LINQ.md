# Language Integrated Queries

But before we even get into `ORMs`, we'll want to go over `LINQ` first.

`LINQ`, or `Language Integrated Queries`, allow us to query any enumerable dataset within the language itself (in this case, `C#`).

Think about all of those algorithms we've done over the past few months where we wanted to loop through arrays of data
and find out whether or not something existed. Or, for those of you who have taken `MERN`, the sorting algorithms.

`LINQ` will allow us to take ANY enumerable dataset, and give us shorthand commands for various searches/sorts.
