# It's Time for Dojeopardy!

Let's do some LINQ Trivia! We'll be testing your LINQ skills with a series of
questions and challenges!

## Instructions:
- You will be assigned into groups and put into breakout rooms
- Among your team, discuss and choose `ONE` representative.
- In Discord, post a message with your team name, team members, and your representative. The format should be something like: `Team Flying Ninjas! Cody, *Jim, Kyle
- Commence friendly banter and competitive speech. Gifs are welcome (and expected)
- When a question is given (keep an eye on Discord!), you will discuss amongst your team, and your designated representative will post your decided upon answer in chat. **IF AN ANSWER IS PROVIDED BY SOMEBODY OTHER THAN YOUR TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, NO POINTS WILL BE AWARDED**. 
- The first team to answer correctly will be rewarded 5 points. The second team will be rewarded 2 points.

At the end of the game, points will be tallied, and a winner will be declared! 

# WHAT DO WE WIN?!
